  /**
   * An optimization that combines a series of identical operations as they appear in the
   * original source.
   * 
   * Consider the following input: `x + y + z`
   * 
   * The parser generates an AST that first evaluates `x + y`, then evaluates the result of
   * that expression and `z`. The corresponding bytecode follows:
   * {{{
   * push x
   * push y
   * add 2
   * push z
   * add 2
   * }}}
   * 
   * The `add 2` instruction tells the interpreter to pop `2` elements from the evaluation
   * stack, compute the sum, and push the result onto the stack. Since the `add` instruction
   * can operate on any number of arguments, both `add` operations can be combined into a
   * single instruction:
   * {{{
   * push x
   * push y
   * push z
   * add 3
   * }}}
   * 
   * A slightly more complicated example illustrates the same principle. Consider the input,
   * `a + (b * c) + d`, and the corresponding bytecode:
   * {{{
   * push a
   * push b
   * push c
   * mul 2
   * add 2
   * push d
   * add 2
   * }}}
   * 
   * Similar to the first scenario, both `add` operations can be combined even though the
   * intervening expression `b * c` exists. Note that adjacency of instructions is not
   * relevant, but rather the equivalence of the evaluation stack frame depth. In other
   * words, all operations of the same type at the same frame can be combined into a single
   * operation.
   * 
   * The algorithm works by simulating execution using an evaluation stack, maintaining a
   * set of instructions that are candidates for elimination. If another instruction at the
   * same frame depth is encountered, the original instruction is replaced with a `nop` and
   * the current instruction modified to evaluate additional elements on the stack. Once
   * all instructions have been evaluated, the set of revisions are applied, resulting in
   * a new sequence of instructions.

  /**
   * An optimization that flattens identical operations adjacent to each other in the
   * instruction sequence.
   * 
   * This optimization is similar to [[combineDynamicOperators]] in that operations are
   * essentially combined, but instead it looks for special cases in which identical operations
   * occur in adjacent frames on the evaluation stack.
   * 
   * Consider the input, `x * (y * z)`, and the corresponding bytecode:
   * {{{
   * push x
   * push y
   * push z
   * mul 2
   * mul 2
   * }}}
   * 
   * Note that both `mul` instructions occur in adjacent positions. At first glance, it may
   * appear as though [[combineDynamicOperators]] would eliminate one of the operations, but
   * each occurs at a different frame on the evaluation stack.
   * 
   * The intuition behind this optimization is that the first `mul 2` would push its result
   * onto the stack, only to be removed for evaluation by the second `mul 2` instruction. So,
   * rather than performing an intermediate calculation, the first can be eliminated in lieu of
   * a single `mul 3` instruction. In general, any number of adjacent identical instructions
   * can be reduced to a single instruction.
   * 
   * One may notice that this phase optimizes right-to-left evaluation scenarios, but only for
   * those operators with the associative property, i.e. evaluation can be left-to-right or
   * right-to-left. This becomes more clear with another example: `a * (b * (c * d))`.
   * The original instruction sequence follows:
   * {{{
   * push a
   * push b
   * push c
   * push d
   * mul 2
   * mul 2
   * mul 2
   * }}}
   * 
   * In essence, the parentheses are being removed and evaluated in a left-to-right manner
   * by eliminating all but the last `mul` instruction:
   * {{{
   * push a
   * push b
   * push c
   * push d
   * mul 4
   * }}}
   * 
   * The algorithm works by stepping through each associative operator instruction, finding
   * adjacent identical pairs, and eliminating all but the final instruction, which is then
   * modified to reflect the combined number of arguments.

  /**
   * An optimization that evaluates literal expressions.
   * 
   * This optimization finds expressions containing only literal values and reduces them to a
   * single value, thereby eliminating the need for the interpreter to perform the computation.
   * 
   * Consider the input, `x + 1 + y + 2`, which produces the following sequence of
   * unoptimized instructions:
   * {{{
   * push x
   * push 1
   * add 2
   * push y
   * add 2
   * push 2
   * add 2
   * }}}
   * 
   * Applying the [[combineDynamicOperators]] optimization produces the following:
   * {{{
   * push x
   * push 1
   * push y
   * push 2
   * add 4
   * }}}
   * 
   * In either case, there is still opportunity to further optimize. Had the original input
   * been written as `x + y + 1 + 2`, it becomes more clear that `1 + 2` could be replaced
   * with `3`. The purpose of this optimization phase is to find such expressions and reduce
   * them to a single value.
   * 
   * In the latter optimized case above, applying this optimization reduces the instruction
   * sequence to the following:
   * {{{
   * push x
   * push y
   * push 3
   * add 3
   * }}}
   * 
   * The algorithm works by simulating execution of the instruction sequence using an evaluation
   * stack, though recording only literal values. As operations are encountered, the optimizer
   * peeks into the evaluation stack to determine if two or more literals are present, and if so,
   * eliminates the `push` instruction corresponding to each literal in lieu of a single `push`.
   * When an optimization is detected, the evaluation terminates and revisions are applied to
   * the original sequence of instructions. This process repeats itself until a complete
   * evaluation yields no new optimizations.
   * 
   * Note that an expression consisting entirely of literals will always be reduced to a single
   * `push` instruction containing the computed value.
